# tsCanvas
tsCanvas is a series of modules that expose easy functions for creating with the Javascript canvas. This is not a game engine, it is a graphics and audio framework.

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the created directory
3. Run `tsc` in the directory and the built JS files will be created in the 'build' directory
