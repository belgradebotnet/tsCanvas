# tsCanvas
tsCanvas is a series of modules that expose easy functions for creating with the Javascript canvas. This is not a game engine, it is a graphics and audio framework.

### Using tsCanvas
tsCanvas provides methods to manipulate the graphics output of a canvas, currently it is split up into multiple moudles but it will eventually be unified with one master module that brings them all together. Meanwhie, you can build it into JavaScript and use it that way.

### Building tsCanvas into JavaScript
To build tsCanvas you'll need to have [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) installed on your machine. 
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the created directory
3. Run `tsc` in the directory and the built JS files will be created in the 'build' directory
